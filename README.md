## About The Project
The economic crisis in Sri Lanka is a serious challenge for the country's education system. It is important to take steps to mitigate the impact of the crisis on schools and to ensure that all children have access to quality education.The group is determined to make a positive impact by designing a university project tailored specifically to support schools and improve learning opportunities for Sri Lankan children.Our group project is to create a donation website for schools in Sri Lanka. The aim of this website is to enable people worldwide to support these schools by making donations. These 
funds will be used to provide essential supplies, recruit new teachers and upgrade the infrastructure required for learning. 

Our platform aims to connect compassionate individuals and deserving schools worldwide. Our belief is that education has the power to break down barriers and transform lives. By joining hands with us, you can become a catalyst for change.Donations made through our website go straight towards improving Sri Lankan schools' learning environment. The raised money is used to provide necessary supplies such as textbooks, stationery, laboratory equipment, and technology resources providing essential tools for academic success
